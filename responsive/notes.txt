Techniques to make website responsive       
-------------------------------------
[1]Set the viewport at the page level
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

[2]Always use max-width/max-height (never use width and height property            

[3]Use CSS media Queries
 
If my device is this then apply that style
If my device is between width 600-700 this than apply that style

4.Use units like rem/vh/vw instead of pixels
